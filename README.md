# mysql2-wrapper-ts
A MySQL ORM written in TypeScript featuring a singleton database connection and a more convenient interface

Originally this was intended to be used in my personal and commercial projects, however I decided that open-sourcing it might help others that are in need of such a wrapper as well, given mysql2's interface is more complicated than it needs to be (in my opinion, anyway).

You're free to use this however you want as long as your use case is covered under the terms of the MIT license.
